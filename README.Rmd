## Overview
`escalation` provides a grammar for dose-finding clinical trials.

It starts by providing functions to use dose-escalation methodologies like CRM, BOIN, and 3+3.
Largely, model-fitting code is imported from existing packages:

* `get_dfcrm()` uses `dfcrm`
* `get_boin()` uses `BOIN`
* there is also `get_three_plus_three()`

These approaches are then fit to trial outcomes to produce dose selector objects that support a common interface.
The two most important methods are `recommended_dose()` to get the current dose selection, and `continue()` to learn whether the model advocates continuing patient recruitment.

With a little bit of plumbing, a dose-selection function could be imported from practically any dose-finding package in R and made to act the same way.

`escalation` then adds optional embellishments to provide extra desirable behaviour:

* `dont_skip_doses()`
* `stop_at_n()`
* `stop_when_n_at_dose()`
* `stop_when_too_toxic()`
* `demand_n_at_dose()`

Each of these functions overrides the way doses are selected or when a design decides to stop.
A powerful feature of `escalation` is that all of these objects supports exactly the same interface, so they can be daisy-chained together using `%>%` operator from the `magrittr` package to create dose-selectors that perform exactly how you want.

Furthermore, having defined this flexible interface for creating dose-finding designs, it is simple to run simulations or calculate dose-pathways for future cohorts of patients.

# Installation
```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Install the latest official version from CRAN with:
install.packages("escalation")

# Alternatively, install the latest code from GitHub:
devtools::install_github("brockk/escalation")
```


## Describing outcomes in dose-finding trials
`escalation` uses a succinct syntax for describing dose-finding outcomes, described in @Brock2019 for the phase I setting and in @Brock2017a for the phase I/II setting.

## Usage

```{r}
library(escalation)
```


### CRM
Let's fit a continual reassessment method (CRM) [@OQuigley1990] model to some outcomes using the implementation in the [dfcrm](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=dfcrm) package by @dfcrm.

The very least information we need to provide is a dose-toxicity skeleton, and our target toxicity level.

```{r}
skeleton <- c(0.05, 0.1, 0.25, 0.4, 0.6)
target <- 0.25

model <- get_dfcrm(skeleton = skeleton, target = target)
```

The `model` can then be fit to outcomes:

```{r}
fit <- model %>% fit('2NNN')
```

and the `fit` object will tell you the dose recommended by the CRM model to be administered next:

```{r}
fit %>% recommended_dose()
```

The model advocates skipping straight to dose 4.
Clinicians are unlikely to feel comfortable with this.
We can respecify the model to expressly not skip doses in escalation:

```{r}
model <- get_dfcrm(skeleton = skeleton, target = target) %>% 
  dont_skip_doses(when_escalating = TRUE)

fit <- model %>% fit('2NNN')
fit %>% recommended_dose()
```

After the addition of `dont_skip_doses`, the two components are now working in concert to conduct the dose-finding experiment.
The net effect here is that dose 3 is recommended for the next patient, rather than being skipped.

We can ask whether the trial wants to keep going:
```{r}
fit %>% continue()
```

Naturally it wants to continue because `dfcrm` does not implement any stopping rules.
However, we can easily add some.
Let us say that we want to stop once the model has evaluated 18 patients, or at least 9 at the dose being recommended, whichever occurs first.
We specify this model by adding more behaviours:

```{r}
model <- get_dfcrm(skeleton = skeleton, target = target) %>% 
  dont_skip_doses(when_escalating = TRUE) %>% 
  stop_at_n(n = 18) %>% 
  stop_when_n_at_dose(dose = 'recommended', n = 9)
```

Let's fit this model to some more patients to see how this trial plays out:
```{r}
fit <- model %>% fit('2NNN 3TTN')
fit %>% recommended_dose()
fit %>% continue()
```

The trial wants to de-escalate and continue.
Let's do that:
```{r}
fit <- model %>% fit('2NNN 3TTN 2TNN')
fit %>% recommended_dose()
fit %>% continue()
```

Again, the design wants to continue at dose 2.
Let's do that:
```{r}
fit <- model %>% fit('2NNN 3TTN 2TNN 2NNT')
fit %>% recommended_dose()
fit %>% continue()
```

Now the design wants to stop and recommend dose 2.

```{r}
fit %>% n_at_dose()
```

This is because it has now seen 9 patients at dose 2 so that our stopping criteria have been met.

```{r}
fit %>% mean_prob_tox()
```

We see that dose 2 is indeed the dose with posterior expected toxicity rate closest to the target of 25%.

### BOIN

This package also implements the BOIN dose-finding design by @liu_bayesian_2015 via the BOIN package [@BOIN].

In contrast to CRM, BOIN does not require a dose-toxicity skeleton.
In its simplest case, it requires merely the number of doses under investigation and our target toxicity level:

```{r}
target <- 0.25

model <- get_boin(num_doses = 5, target = target)
```

As before, we can fit the model to some observed outcomes:
```{r}
fit <- model %>% fit('2NNN')
fit %>% recommended_dose()
fit %>% continue()
```

The BOIN dose selector natively implements stopping rules, as described by Suyu & Yuan.
For instance, if the bottom dose is too toxic, thhe design will advise to halt:
```{r}
fit <- model %>% fit('2NTN 1TTT')
fit %>% recommended_dose()
fit %>% continue()
```

Nevertheless, as with the CRM examples above, our BOIN selector can be adorned with various rules to control sample size, etc:
```{r}
model <- get_boin(num_doses = 5, target = target) %>% 
  dont_skip_doses(when_escalating = TRUE) %>% 
  stop_at_n(n = 18) %>% 
  stop_when_n_at_dose(dose = 'recommended', n = 9)

fit <- model %>% fit('2NNN 3TTN 2TNN 2NNT')
fit %>% recommended_dose()
fit %>% continue()
```


## Future Plans

I plan to add model-fitting functions for:

* CRM and EffTox via [trialr](https://cran.r-project.org/package=trialr)
* CRM via [crmPack](https://cran.r-project.org/package=crmPack)
* EWOC and mTPI once I discover how those designs are implemented in R.

I want to add stopping functions for each of the approaches investigated by @zohar_continual_2001.

Finally, I want to add general sunctions to perform simulations and calculate all possible future dose paths.
Given the standard interface implemented in `escalation`, each of these approaches will be opened up to every specifiable dose selector.
That is the beauty of object-oriented programming.
