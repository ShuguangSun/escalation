# Overview
`dose` provides a grammar for dose-finding clinical trials.

It starts by providing functions to use dose-escalation methodologies like CRM, BOIN, and 3+3.
Largely, model-fitting code is imported from existing packages:

* `get_dfcrm()` uses `dfcrm`
* `get_boin()` uses `BOIN`
* there is also `get_three_plus_three()`

These approaches are then fit to trial outcomes to produce dose selector objects that support a common interface.
The two most important methods are `recommended_dose()` to get the current dose selection, and `continue()` to learn whether the model advocates continuing patient recruitment.

With a little bit of plumbing, a dose-selection function could be imported from practically any dose-finding package in R and made to act the same way.

`dose` then adds optional embellishments to provide extra desirable behaviour:

* `dont_skip_doses()`
* `stop_at_n()`
* `stop_when_n_at_dose()`
* `stop_when_too_toxic()`
* `demand_n_at_dose()`

Each of these functions overrides the way doses are selected or when a design decides to stop.
A powerful feature of `dose` is that all of these objects supports exactly the same interface, so they can be daisy-chained together using `%>%` operator from the `magrittr` package to create dose-selectors that perform exactly how you want.

Furthermore, having defined this flexible interface for creating dose-finding designs, it is simple to run simulations or calculate dose-pathways for future cohorts of patients.
