TODO:

* Add a finally_select_boin_dose function fitter that uses BOIN::select.mtd
* Also, a finally selector for Mozgunov + Jaki CIPD method.
* finish dose paths, incl starting mid-way through trial
* print methods
* demand_n_at_dose needs to be reactive when recommended_dose == NA
* try_safety_dose needs to be like demand_n_at_dose but only kicks in when recommended_dose == NA.
